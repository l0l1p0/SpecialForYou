                You're special, you know that? You're unique.
                NO one has you personality. No one can smile the way you do.
                No one else is like you. No matter how similar someone may look or act like you,
                no one is truly you. A world without you would be different, no matter how you see it.
                Every existence holds an importance,both big and small. You're still here for a reason.
                You're still breathing for a reason. You're continued reading this for a reason.
                You're having a hard time in life, life has been hard overall, whichever it is,
                just remember that you're not alone in this.People mour everyday for those struggling,
                those who are hurting. Someone cares about you.And don't say no one does,
                because i do.Don't give up
